# Ape Tavern Web

This repository contains the code for Ape Tavern's website. It is written with SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS, and deployed with Vercel.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

Furthemore, a launch configuration exists for VSCode that runs the app for you. Feel free to add launch configurations for other development environments.

## Deploying

This app is automatically deployed to Vercel when a commit is made to the master branch.
